# Have I been pwned Composer package

To increse security of users on your system, I started building a client for [@TroyHunt](https://twitter.com/troyhunt)'s [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) API v2 that will check if a given password was already used in a breach. Many thanks to Mr. Troy Hunt for providing us this service.

## Project scope

The goal of this project is to have a [composer package](https://packagist.org) that will allow you to quickly verify if a given password (from a registration or password reset form) was found in a data breach so you can inform your users to change their password and thus improving overal security.

## License

I've provided this project "as-is" and I licensed it with an [MIT license](LICENSE) so you can use it freely in your projects.
